asuswrt-phantom
==============

This is an enhanced version of Asuswrt-merlin - the firmware used by all recent Asus routers. 

The goal of this project is to include openvpn scramble patch and optimize the setting in the firmware for high speed broadband user.

At this time, the supported devices are:

- RT-N66U
- RT-AC66U
- RT-AC56U
- RT-AC68U & RT-AC68P (including revision C1)
- RT-AC87U
- RT-AC3200
- RT-AC88U
- RT-AC3100
- RT-AC5300
- RT-AC1900 & RT-AC1900P


NOTE: all the "R" versions (for example RT-N66R) are the same as their 
"U" counterparts, they are just different packages aimed at large 
retailers.  The firmware is 100% compatible with both U and R versions 
of the routers.  Same with the "W" variants that are simply white.


No longer officially supported:
- RT-N16
